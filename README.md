My Future Portfolio / Playground

Hello everyone! This repository is dedicated to improving my knowledge of web technologies, creating my portfolio webpage, and transitioning from a C#/System developer to a full-stack web developer.

I will be following the FullStack roadmap to become a full-stack developer:  
https://roadmap.sh/full-stack

## Theory Training:  
To achieve this, I will train in the following areas:

* **Front-end** - https://roadmap.sh/frontend
  * **JavaScript** - https://roadmap.sh/javascript
  * **React** - https://roadmap.sh/react
  * ...

* **Back-end** - https://roadmap.sh/backend
  * **Node.js** - https://roadmap.sh/nodejs
  * **GoLang**
  * ...

Additionally, I want to learn:

* **TypeScript** - https://roadmap.sh/typescript
* ...

This plan will be updated as I explore new technologies.

## Practice:  
This section will contain repositories where I practice and improve my skills.

* **Tailwind** - https://github.com/LanternOfDarkness/tailwind-training-1
